DemSchoolTools
=====================================

DemSchoolTools is a database that excels at managing Judicial Committee records for [Sudbury](http://sudval.org/)-inspired schools. In addition, it does a satisfactory job of tracking people (students, parents, donors, and others), student attendance, and the management manual.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/schmave/demschooltools/wiki/) for more information.
