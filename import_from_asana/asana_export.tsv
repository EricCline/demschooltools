 Our People Network	Jessica Heathcote	Wilkinsburg jessica.heathcote@gmail.com 724-496-3533  Interest form comment: "Interests:  I'm interested in alternative schooling, especially working with younger students in less-structured environments.  I've spent the past 5 years teaching English and 'critical thinking'  to community college students and individuals in an adult basic education (pre-GED) program.  After seeing how institutional structure limits the potential for students to take intellectual risks, and spending lots of time in the classroom trying to work against that limit, I'd like to redirect my energies to a project which works to establish confidence and self-direction in students from their very first experiences with school.  Skills: I have a masters degree in Cultural Studies, a bachelors in English, and I bring a lot of traditional and non-traditional teaching experience with me.  Working in the adult basic education program has allowed me to see how self-motivated students can indeed design their own learning paths.  I've had experience helping assist science and social studies inquiries, creative writing workshops, journalism courses, and environmental explorations.    I also have experience designing spaces and would love to share that skill as a building is found and transformed into a vibrant, stimulating space for children.    I can also assist with any kind of public relations communication and web/print content creation."

	Megan Pinney comment 	received a thoughtful reply from her. "I think that kids begin their lives being comfortable with themselves and accepting of others and with a maturity that we don't expect and don't value and we quickly strip those qualities away. We condition them to conform, tear down their creativity, teach them to pick out differences instead of similarities. It's heartbreaking. Being more or less aware of what we do to kids in general, I want to make sure that I don't do that to MY kids. So I'm researching alternative methods of education (Homeschooling? Sudbury? A charter with a particular focus?) and I keep coming across talks by awesome kids who have experienced some level of freedom in their education. So it's scary to just let go and find out who a kid is, all on her own, but with enough evidence to show that it's okay, I think we've got to make ourselves do it.

 Our People Network	Stacey Atwell-Keister	staceyatwellkeister@gmail.com 412-508-2296  Forest Hills  My husband and I are both teachers - I have an expired K-12 music PA certificate and have taught choral and general music, theater, and humanities, along with piano and voice lessons. Â My husband has taught in private and parochial schools - mostly middle school math, but also economics, English, general science, and psychology. Â He is not certified. Â We have a 6-year-old and a 3.5-year-old that we are homeschooling, with one more on the way. Â I'm currently the founder and director of the Ellsworth Avenue Children's Choir (ages 5-13) and working as an administrator at a grassroots non-profit doula agency that was recently swallowed up by UPMC. Â My husband and I are excellent money managers with good business sense, and we both love geeky things like databases and spreadsheets. Â   Looking forward to seeing where this goes! Â The Quaker community that I belong to (Pittsburgh Friends Meeting) has been talking about starting a school for a long time - this may be a collaboration that the parents there are interested in pursuing.

 Our People Network	Patty Martinez	compsox1@gmail.com 412-512-3308 Beechview  I am a stay-at-home mom with 2 kids ages 13 and 14. Â We are homeschooling and I feel that my son would greatly benefit from your school. Â I am willing to do anything that is asked that I am capable of doing. Â   I understand that you work on a sliding scale. I am not sure I would need assistance but am interested in learning more about this.  I am excited to offer this to my kids, especially my son, who would fit right into this philosophy.  Thank you so much for considering our family.  I could not get to the social today but would love to speak with someone about your school and if there is any preparation my son/daughter would need to attend.  Thanks for bringing this wonderful opportunity to Pgh.

 Our People Network	Rebecca Ashkettle	Penn Hills beckyashkettle@yahoo.com 412-203-3132  I am a homeschooling mother of three children.  Before having kids, I was a teacher in a very small, progressive, arts and exploration-based private school.  I am not sure exactly how and what to share with a project such as this, but definitely want to find out more about it for my family.

 Our People Network	Kristilee Williams	Bellevue, soon to be Brighton Heights heyitskristilee@gmail.com 412.877.2657  Interest form comment: Well let's see, I work in a,public library where I manage social media presence and teach digital literacy, I am a freelance writer, and I am also a founding member of a local time bank. If you were thinking of having people doing volunteer work, the time bank might be a handy way to manage that.  I've been involved in and taught in homeschool coops for the past 12 or so years. I guess I could do just about anything from scrubbing floors to techy stuff, whatever is needed.  This is awesome.   Filled out interest form again on 4/7/13: I'd be willing to help with anything that was needed, from cleaning to collecting supplies to administrative stuff or whatever....you can check my LinkedIn page for an idea of what kinds of things I am doing now:  http://www.linkedin.com/in/kristilee

Being involved with a freeschool would be a fantastic and memorable life experience. Sorry to have basically dumped a rather informal rÃ©sumÃ© on you, but when I think of a freeschool staff member, I think of a talented, flexible Jill/Jack-of-all-trades; someone who may have a specialty, but who can bounce around from one mode of thinking to another at the whim of their students. I humbly think I fit that bill perfectly (I'm sure my son and Unschooling friends would agree).   Thanks for your time :)"	2012-10-16T00:52:36.305Z	Evan Mallory

He has not been formally diagnosed with ADHD-ADD, but fits the criteria. He is struggling in school due to the inability to sit still, etc. Would this type of school be a good fit for him?	2012-10-18T00:30:53.202Z	Evan Mallory

My dissertation was on "Exploring Democracy in Preschool Settings." I have relocated to Pittsburgh an am hoping to open a small, democratic infant/toddler/preschool program in the future.  I was excited to discover your upcoming school via the AERO listserve. I'd love to collaborate and would be happy to volunteer in any capacity you see fit.  Best of luck!
